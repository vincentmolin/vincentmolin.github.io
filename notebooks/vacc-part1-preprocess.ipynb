Each comment has first been labeled individually as either 1 or 0, expressing a positive or negative stance respectively. All comments have after that also independently been labeled by at least one other annotator, as we will see. Let's start up `pandas`, our data handling package of choice, and inspect some rows!\n"],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-d1ea152e-2e04-4472-93bb-3649dc3ed3be","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-e0fb319c-72d2-422e-bed3-b6b33aa0e2a7","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"94728e75","execution_millis":33,"execution_start":1613512419960,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# These comments are pretty long\n","pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\n","\n","# Technically not a csv but pandas don't mind\n","df = pd.read_csv('vacc_train_data.tsv', sep='\\t', names=['target','comment'])\n","\n","for row in df.loc[:5,'comment']:\n","    print('\"' + row + '\"\\n')"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\" It is easier to fool a million people than it is to convince a million people that they have been fooled. - Mark Twain\"\n","\n","\" NATURAL IMMUNITY  protected us since evolution.
